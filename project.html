                                            initially began as a series of informative skits and interviews. Following the education mandate of the broadcaster, the show managed to present anti-smoking, safety and environmental issues with funding from provincial government agencies and private companies. The entire cast of the show were children,<br> who acted in various sketches and portrayed journalists. At the age of 12, Chalke was the program's environmental reporter.

                                            One of the recurring sketches on KidZone was Kerrisdale V6M 1Z6, which used a style similar to Beverly Hills, 90210 and Degrassi Junior High to present youth issues. Eventually, KidZone shifted away from its journalistic style and became a docudrama about high school based on the Kerrisdale sketch. This version of the show also aired in the United States as Kerrisdale High.

                                                Praying is like talking to your best friend!<br> It’s easy to talk to someone when-
                                                <br> you know they love you unconditionally!<br>
                                                Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins <br>and make you new in Him! “Now turn from your- <br>sins and turn to God, so you can be cleansed of your sins”.
                                                <br>Tell Him your needs! “<br>Give all your worries and cares to God,<br> for he cares about what happens to you”.
                                                <br> Thank Him, for He died on the cross at Calvary-<br> for us! “For God so loved the world that<br> he gave his only Son, so that everyone <br>who believes in him will not <br>perish but have eternal life” .

                                                <br>The toothbrush is an oral<br> hygiene instrument-<br> used to clean the teeth, gums, <br>and tongue. <br>It consists of a head of tightly<br> clustered bristle--atop of <br>which toothpaste is supposed to go--mounted on a handle <br>which facilitates the cleaning of <br>hard-to-reach areas of the mouth.
                                                Using a toothbrush with fluoride toothpaste<br> is essential to good oral health.<br> Not only does brushing<br> your teeth help prevent tooth decay, <br>it also helps prevent gum disease, which is one of <br>the leading causes of tooth loss in adults<br> and has been linked to heart attacks and strokes.

                                                Milk. Due to its nutritional value<br> and the role it plays in growth and development,<br> milk is an important drink for children. Along with cheese and yoghurt,<br> milk is part of the dairy food group that provides<br> children with an important source of calcium,<br> which is essential for strong bones and teeth.
                                                Kids who don't drink cow's milk are just as<br> healthy as those who do, studies show.<br> In fact, research suggests that <br>milk-free kids may be less likely to develop colic,<br> ear infections, and asthma.<br> The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't recommend <br>cow's milk for children younger than one.
